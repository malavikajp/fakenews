        <div class="headline">NASA Accidentally Emails Earth’s Nuclear Codes to Alien Civilization!</div>
        <p class="content">
            March 19, 2025 – Houston, TX – In what is being called the biggest cybersecurity blunder in history, a junior NASA intern has reportedly accidentally emailed Earth’s nuclear launch codes to an unknown alien civilization in deep space.
            
            According to leaked reports, the intern—who remains unnamed—was attempting to transmit a routine radio wave signal to a recently discovered exoplanet, Gliese-832c, located 16 light-years away. However, due to what officials are calling a “tragic copy-paste error,” the message accidentally included top-secret global nuclear launch codes instead of a pre-approved greeting message.
            
            “The intended message was simply a friendly ‘Hello from Earth,’” said a NASA spokesperson in a tense press conference. “Unfortunately, it appears that the intern mistakenly attached highly sensitive documents before hitting send.”
            
            The unintended recipients? An unknown extraterrestrial civilization that scientists suspect may be capable of decoding the message.
            
            Alien Response Incoming?
            What has officials even more concerned is that, within three hours of transmission, astronomers at the SETI Institute detected a mysterious signal bouncing back from the same star system. Scientists are now working frantically to decode the alien response, which some fear could be an ultimatum or a declaration of interstellar war.
            
            Global Panic Ensues
            Governments worldwide have issued emergency meetings, and security experts are calling this a “worst-case scenario” for intergalactic diplomacy. Conspiracy theorists believe this may confirm long-standing rumors that Earth is already being monitored by extraterrestrials.
            
            Despite global concern, some internet users have taken a lighter approach, with memes circulating under the hashtag #NASAYouHadOneJob.
            
            Meanwhile, NASA has reassured the public that they are “working on a solution”, though how one retracts a message sent across the cosmos remains unclear.
            
            More updates as the situation unfolds.
